Package: SCISSORS
Title: Identify cell subpopulations in single cell RNA-seq data
Version: 1.2.0
Author: Jack Leary [aut]
Maintainer: Jack Leary <jrleary@live.unc.edu>
Description: SCISSORS allows users to easily identify cell subtypes and other subpopulations in scRNA-seq data. The method is predicated on the usage of a cosine-distance based silhouette score that is calculated for each cluster and indicates goodness of fit. Several different sets of parameters are used, and the subclustering that maximizes this measure is considered optimal.
